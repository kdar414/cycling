<ins>*MAPMATCHING*</ins>

- I have located Sophie's mapmatching information - she has tested a bunch of options and appears to have narrowed it down to <ins>ORSM and Leuvenmapmatching</ins>

  - Concerns about OSRM last linked to accuracy - the results are dependent on GPS accuracy. This can sometimes result in mapmatching to          the path not a road but cannot remove these as cycling can be on the path.
  - Concerns about Leuvenmapmatching related to difficulty of precise mapmatching.
  - **Overall leaning towards OSRM** but waiting for an issue associated with unnamed roads to be addressed.
  - Information accessed from **cycling-pollution-sophie/code/_old/code_notes.txt** and **code/_old/mapmatching_testing.py**
