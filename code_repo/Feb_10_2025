**Starting notes** 
- Segmentation code appears to work for the ngapipi data, next step is to interpolate
- Need to join the mapmatched data with the pollution data at some point but not sure when it is best to do so.
- Going to progress with the test data for now (ngapipi) and once this is working try with the cycling data
