**Meeting with Sila**
- Questions:
    - Should segmentation be run on all of Aucklnd or run each time for each cycle route. **Run segementation for all of Auckland so that the segments remain the same across the analysis**
    - Is there a specific radius for mapmatching (tested r= 10,20,50). **See other papers who use the same algorithm for cycling/car, other than that 50 seems good**.
 
- If SegUID does not work we can try to work around it: let Sila know if Sophie does not reply by Friday.
- Once segmented and mapmatched - should make box plots for different routes and segments. Number of dates we have data we have and timeseries figures of pollution through the day can be produced.

|   | Columns should be time in s |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Rows should be the segment  | Number of repeats  |

- Can work on mapmatching the rest of the cycles even if segmentation not prepared.
