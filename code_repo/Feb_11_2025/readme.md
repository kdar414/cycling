**Questions**
- When should I be joining the pollution and mapmatched data?
- Little bit confused about how the segmentation is related to interpolation

**Meeting with Sila**
- Try the interpolation with another area
- plot the segmentation (get_Graph using the ngapipi road)
- Looks like an edge was created between two nodes at some point and that the weird graph output is connecting to that path
- Run the centroid code based on the seg_uid instead
-
