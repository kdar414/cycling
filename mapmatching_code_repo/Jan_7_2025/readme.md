7_Jan_25 - contains the code that was working to do mapmatching on the date of the filename. The sudo docker at the start must be entered into terminal before running the code.

html files are the output maps showing the mapmatching - they contain:
  the date of creation
  an r value which stands for radius e.g. in this file route_map_osrm-docker_7_Jan_r10.html the radius was 10 meters
